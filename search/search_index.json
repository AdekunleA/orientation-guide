This orientation guide is created for early adopters of the Cluster Community. We are absolutely thrilled you\u2019ve made the decision to engage with our platform and to adopt the Cluster model as part of your organization\u2019s employment strategy. We are co-creating the new generation of employment, and that in itself is something to celebrate. Please know that your engagement and feedback is strongly encouraged as your input will help us transform and improve the platform and process moving forward. The Orientation guide is designed to lead you through the process: engaging with the platform, connecting with employers, forming clusters and filling cluster roles. Every cluster is unique and a reflection of the parties involved so feel free to leverage your own creativity to make it your own where applicable. What we are providing in this document are best practices, terminology and information gained from our experiences creating and developing the Cluster Employment Model. Thank you, sincerely, for being part of this innovation. Sincerely, Matt Thomson & Bradley Daye Co-Founders, Cluster Employment Cluster Employment Platform The Cluster employment platform is a one stop shop to connect with employers who are looking for part-time talent to come together and form Clusters. Employers can use the platform as a way to attract/retain talent, gain access to high caliber talent, as employees and employers under the Cluster model will get access to exclusive health benefits. Platform community engagement The platform allows for community engagement with other employers to learn and share best practices about innovating the way you attract and retain talent within your organization. \"It\u2019s always a struggle to find that sweet spot where we have enough work to hire someone, especially in a non-production, or administrative role. We get to a level where our team is feeling stressed but we just aren\u2019t to the financial level where we can justify a full time person.\" -Shannon Leblanc, Hallmark Dental Building your organizational profile As an employer you will be able to create your organizational profile. Your profile will include organizational information including your mission, values and the industry you are in. This will help you match and connect with other employers and will be of particular interest to those who share your values. (Alignment amongst organizations makes for a strong cluster!) Additionally, the more information you provide, the better you will be able to match with other employers that have similar talent needs. Please follow the steps below to complete your organization profile. Click your user profile icon on the upper right corner of the screen Click settings Navigate to the organizations tab in the settings menu Fill in the required fields under the \u2018 Organization\u2019 section Create your organization To add members to your organization, send them the secret code that is located at the bottom of your organizational profile. This allows other members access to create Clusters and post on behalf of the organization. Community Coin The CC model will be used as a way to purchase services from the Cluster website, this will also allow exchange or donating of credits to other organizations and allows users to be charged for specific services used. Users benefit from this approach in that they get to access most of the platform\u2019s features free of charge. Creating a listing This tab will allow you to create a job listing for the part time job you are looking to fill using Cluster Employment. The listing will be public on the platform and interested employers will have the opportunity to check the listing and contact you if they are interested in forming a cluster. Each Cluster opportunity listing will cost 1 Community Coin which can be purchased under the Community Coin tab on the home page. Click the \u2018Create a Listing\u2019 button at the top of the page Fill in following information in the tab marked \u201cbody\u201d Position title Position responsibilities Number of hours Location (specify if remote location) Minimum requirements Click the \u2018Create a Listing\u2019 button to submit information and create listing Connecting with the employer As a potential Cluster employer you will have the opportunity to connect with employers who have similar talent needs. Once employers' needs are aligned they will have the ability to engage and chat about the position details including designation of the lead employer. If you are interested in creating a Cluster Opportunity with an employer, you can connect by responding to a cluster listing, Otherwise, you can reach out to potential employers on the feed or through referring them to the Cluster platform. Lead Employer One of the employers is designated as a Lead employer, a Lead employer will take over all the administrative duties of the employee and will bill an admin fee that will be split by all parties to put the necessary financial structures in place such as billing the talent, setting up direct withdrawals, payments and identifying the cost for MERCS and split between employers. Scheduling and work place Employers should discuss how many hours they would need the employee to work each week, and if there are any changes that need to be made, said changes would be coordinated with the employee first. Previously employers would elect to have arrangements such that an employee would work Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday for one employer and Thursday, Friday for the second employer. Others would elect to have one week with one employer and the next week with the second employer. When deciding what the arrangement is, consider what your needs are, how to best activate the employee with each organization. Alignment of employers This is an important aspect of creating viable Clusters, employers need to ensure that their needs are aligned with each other, as well as the expectations for the employee. Thus it is important to ensure deep and open conversations. Below are a list of questions that can be answered to ensure open and transparent communication. What is your mission and vision as an organization? What do you envision this employee would contribute to your organization? What are your short term and long objectives for the employee? How do you manage employees in your organization? What is your leadership style? How do you reward employees? How do you measure the success of your organization and your staff? How do you pay your employees? Do you have HR capacity in your organization? Government supports Cluster employment allows for the utilizations of government funding and grants if one of the organizations is eligible. The lead employer in this case would have to be the eligible organization, which will apply for and receive the funding. For some of the funding opportunities like Graduate to Opportunity (GTO), where the employee has to be employed for six months before the funding is provided, the lead employer would apply for the funding and once the wage subsidy is received, it will be split amongst the other organizations, until a time that employers would pay for subsidy free salaries. A list of all the grants and funding sources are available here . Benefits election Benefits is an integral part of establishing a strong foundation for employees at a workplace as research indicates that providing employees with benefits results in stability, security, higher retention, high employee morale and overall healthier populations. Lead employers need to provide proof that they have benefits and can provide benefits to the Cluster employee, this will be done in collaboration with the Owens MacFadyen Group. In the case that the employers are unable to offer benefits they can access the Cluster employment platform benefits package provided through Honey bee. Employers who have a Cluster employee signed up through Honey Bee will be eligible to offer the benefits package to all employees in both organizations. Documents required to form a cluster Memorandum of Understanding Once employers have connected and decided to go through a Cluster model, each employer will click on form a Cluster this will allow each employer access to the Memorandum of understanding which provides the roles and responsibilities of each employer in the Cluster arrangement. Please read this form carefully as each employer is legally responsible for these conditions. Opportunity Brief This is a job description done right. It decomodifies the search by showcasing values and culture of employers. Employers are encouraged to write out what the work environment will look like, the culture of the organizations, teams dynamics and fun work activities. Each organization will also get the chance to include the specific and collective requirements for the ideal candidate. Contract The contract will be provided as a templated document and employers will be provided with space to include agreed upon salary, benefits, vacation, and conditions unique to their organizations before sending it to the successful candidate. Recruiting a candidate Advertising requirements To adhere to equitable hiring practices, all positions should be advertised for a minimum of 3 weeks. At least 3 methods of recruitment that are consistent with the occupation (targets an audience that has the appropriate education, professional experience or skill level required for the occupation), in addition to the JobBank. Positions can be posted on the following job boards, in addition to any other job boards that employers are affiliated with. Jobbank.ca (feature of job match, matches you with the best candidates for the position) (Free) ISANS skills match job board (Free) Team works (Free) University/College websites (SMU, DAL, NSCC, Mount, etc) (Free) Indeed (Paid service) CareerBeacon (Paid service) Career Owl (Paid service) HR support Identify the main skills and qualifications that aligns with all organizations The vetting process should include screening and selecting candidates for interviews. Any organization can take on that role, or there could be a split in the responsibilities (e.g Organization A can vet Indeed candidates and Organization B can vet Job Bank candidates) If there is a split on the vetting process then a screening guide needs to be used. The screening guide would provide a framework for candidate selection. In preparation for the interview, organizations need to prepare their own questions and add it to a master interview questionnaire. Organizations can use the following assessment guide to take notes and identify employees. All employers are required to interview the candidate to ensure alignment with the needs of their organization. After the candidate has been selected, have a meeting with all the employers and the candidate. This ensures that the candidate and the employers have a common understanding and an open line of communication. Regular check in\u2019s between the employers will help make the candidate more engaged. Each employer should outline the role expectations with the candidate What collaborative aspects can the employee work on with both organizations? Think outside the box Tax implications An agreement would be entered into with the other \u201cemployers\u201d to cover cost sharing amounts for wages and benefits, and the lead employer will also charge a fee for providing the payroll services. The cost sharing part (ie. wages billed by a lead employer over to the non-lead employers) would not be taxable for HST since the cost sharing agreement could clearly indicate that they are not in business together, but rather that they intend to share costs thereby increasing their own respective profits, which would point towards an agency relationship. Any service fee charged by the lead employer to the others would be taxable.

Further, verbal or written notice will be given to all parties. The terms for the termination notice are outlined below, these terms are also included in the Employment contract. Termination of Employment for Just Cause As Employers you may terminate the employment without notice for any reason that amounts to just cause.
